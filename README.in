General Information
===================

This package contains example programs that demonstrate common usage of
the libfreespace library.


Building
========

Before building, ensure that the libfreespace libraries are installed.

If building on the target machine, the process is as simple as
running:

./configure
make


Cross Compiling Example:

This example assumes:
- libfreespace-examples is being built for a mipsel-linux host.
- libfreespace was successfully built for the same mipsel-linux 
 host and installed to an accessible directory.
- the mipsel-linux-gcc is in the path

./configure CC=mipsel-linux-gcc --host=mipsel-linux --target=mipsel-linux \ 
 --prefix=<install location> LDFLAGS=-L<path to libusb libs directory> \
 CFLAGS=-I<path to libusb include directory>
make
make install 

The configure step will fail if the libfreespace headers are not found.


Troubleshooting
===============

See the libfreespace README for troubleshooting.
